#time series
Creating a time series
The ts() function will convert a numeric vector into an R time series object. The format is ts(vector, start=, end=, frequency=) where start and end are the times of the first and last observation and frequency is the number of observations per unit time (1=annual, 4=quartly, 12=monthly, etc.).
# save a numeric vector containing 48 monthly observations
# from Jan 2009 to Dec 2014 as a time series object
myts <- ts(myvector, start=c(2009, 1), end=c(2014, 12), frequency=12) 

# subset the time series (June 2014 to December 2014)
myts2 <- window(myts, start=c(2014, 6), end=c(2014, 12)) 

# plot series
plot(myts)
